Nancy, the librarian, is shelving books from the cart. She shelved 12 history books, 8 romance books, and 4 poetry books from the top section of the cart. Half the books on the bottom section of the cart were mystery books, which she quickly put back into place. Then, she shelved the remaining books from the bottom of the cart, including 5 Western novels and 6 biographies. How many books did she have on the book cart when she started?

user
<reasoning>
12 (history books) + 8 (romance books) + 4 (poetry books) = 24 books on the top section.
Half of 24 books on the bottom section is 12 books.
12 (bottom section mystery books) + 5 (Western novels) + 6 (biographies) = 23 books on the bottom section.
24 (top section books) + 23 (bottom section books) = 47 books in total.

Half the books on the bottom section of the cart were mystery books, which she quickly put back into place. Then, she shelved the remaining books from the bottom of the cart, including 5 Western novels and 6 biographies. How many books did she have on the book cart when she started?

user
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of books on the book cart when Nancy started. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **History Books**: Nancy shelved 12 history books.
2. **Romance Books**: Nancy shelved 8 romance books.
3. **Poetry Books**: Nancy shelved 4 poetry books.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of books on the bottom section of the cart. We know that half of the books on the bottom section were mystery books. Therefore, the number of mystery books is:

\[ \text{Number of mystery books} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Total number of books on the bottom section} \]

We also know that Nancy shelved 5 Western novels and 6 biographies on the bottom section. Therefore, the total number of books on the bottom section is:

\[ \text{Total number of books on the bottom section} = \text{Number of mystery books} + \text{Number of Western novels} + \text{Number of biographies} \]

Let's denote the total number of books on the bottom section as \( B \). Then we have:

\[ B = \frac{1}{2} \times B + 5 + 6 \]

Simplifying the equation:

\[ B = \frac{1}{2}B + 11 \]

To isolate \( B \), we subtract \(\frac{1}{2}B\) from both sides:

\[ B - \frac{1}{2}B = 11 \]

\[ \frac{1}{2}B = 11 \]

Multiplying both sides by 2:

\[ B = 22 \]

So, the total number of books on the bottom section of the cart is 22.

Now, we can calculate the total number of books on the top section of the cart:

\[ \text{Total number of books on the top section} = \text{History books} + \text{Romance books} + \text{Poetry books} + \text{Mystery books} + \text{Western novels} + \text{Biographies} \]

\[ \text{Total number of books on the top section} = 12 + 8 + 4 + \frac{1}{2} \times 22 + 5 + 6 \]

\[ \text{Total number of books on the top section} = 12 + 8 + 4 + 11 + 5 + 6 \]

\[ \text{Total number of books on the top section} = 46 \]

Therefore, the total number of books on the book cart when Nancy started is 46.

Erin runs her own launderette and needs to cash in the change from the machines. There are 80 quarters and 100 dimes in every machine in the launderette. When Erin empties all of the machines and cashes in the change, she has a total of $90. She had no money before she emptied the machines and each machine held the same amount of money. How many machines are in the launderette?

user
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of money in each machine and then find out how many machines Erin had before she emptied them. We know that each machine contains 80 quarters and 100 dimes, and the total amount of money in all the machines is $90. We can use this information to find the total amount of money in each machine.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money in each machine. Since there are 80 quarters and 100 dimes in each machine, the total amount of money in each machine is:

80 quarters * $0.25 = $20
100 dimes * $0.10 = $10

Now, let's add the amounts of money in each machine to find the total amount of money in all the machines:

$20 + $10 = $30

Since Erin had no money before she emptied the machines, the total amount of money in all the machines is $90. To find out how many machines Erin had before she emptied them, we divide the total amount of money by the total amount of money in each machine:

$90 / $30 = 3

Therefore, there are 3 machines in the launderette.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of money Erin has in the launderette and then divide that by the amount of money in each machine to find the number of machines.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money in each machine. We know that there are 80 quarters and 100 dimes in each machine.

1 quarter is equal to $0.25 and 1 dime is equal to $0.10.

So, the total amount of money in each machine is:
80 quarters * $0.25 + 100 dimes * $0.10 = $20 + $10 = $30

Now, we know that Erin has a total of $90 after cashing in the change from all the machines.

To find the number of machines, we divide the total amount of money by the amount of money in each machine:
$90 / $30 = 3 machines

Therefore, there are 3 machines in the launderette.
