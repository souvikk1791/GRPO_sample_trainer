Penny buys 4 pairs of socks for $2 a pair and a hat for $7. How much money does Penny have left?\nassistant\nTo determine how much money Penny has left after her purchases, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost of the socks:\n   Penny buys 4 pairs of socks at $2 per pair.\n   \\[\n   4 \\text{ pairs} \\times \\$2 \\text{ per pair} = \\$8\n   \\]\n\n2. Add the cost of the socks to the cost of the hat to find the total amount spent:\n   \\[\n   \\$8 + \\$7 = \\$15\n   \\]\n\n3. Subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money Penny had:\n   Penny started with $20.\n   \\[\n   \\$20 - \\$15 = \\$5\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Penny has left is \\boxed{5}."

If the number of people going to the fair this year is 600, calculate the number of people at the fair in the three years.\nassistant\nFirst, let's calculate the number of people going to the fair next year. Since there will be twice as many people going next year as are going this year, we can say:\n\nNext year's population = This year's population * 2\nNext year's population = 600 * 2\nNext year's population = 1200\n\nNext year's population is given to be twice as many as this year, so we can say:\n\nThis year's population = Next year's population / 2\nThis year's population = 1200 / 2\nThis year's population = 600\n\nNext year's population is also given to be 200 less than this year's population, so we can say:\n\nThis year's population = Next year's population - 200\n600 = 1200 - 200\n600 = 1000\n\nThis statement is true, so we have confirmed the given information.\n\nNow, let's calculate the number of people going to the fair last year. Since this year's population is 600, we can say:\n\nLast year's population = This year's population / 2\nLast year's population = 600 / 2\nLast year's population = 300\n\nSo, the number of people at the fair in the three years are:\n- This year: 600\n- Next year: 1200\n- Last year: 300\n\nThe answer is 600, 1200, and 300."

He caught the ball 23 times. Derek made four less than double the catches Joe did. Tammy caught the ball sixteen more than a third of the times Derek did. How many times did Tammy catch the ball?\nassistant\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. Joe caught the ball 23 times.\n\n2. Derek made four less than double the catches Joe did. \n   - Double the catches Joe did = 2 * 23 = 46\n   - Four less than double the catches Joe did = 46 - 4 = 42\n\n3. Tammy caught the ball sixteen more than a third of the times Derek did.\n   - A third of the catches Derek did = 46 / 3 ≈ 15.33\n   - Sixteen more than a third of the catches Derek did = 15.33 + 16 = 31.33\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a catch, we'll round this to the nearest whole number:\n   - 31.33 rounded to the nearest whole number is 31\n\nTherefore, Tammy caught the ball 31 times."

Joe caught the ball 23 times.\n2. Derek made four less than double the catches Joe did. So, Derek made 2 * 23 - 4 = 42 catches.\n3. Tammy caught the ball sixteen more than a third of the times Derek did. So, Tammy made (1/3) * 42 + 16 = 14 more than a third of Derek's catches. This means Tammy made 42 + 16 = 58 catches.\n\nTherefore, Tammy caught the ball 58 times."

On Monday he drove 18 miles.  Tuesday he drove 26 miles.  Wednesday and Thursday he drove 20 miles each day and on Friday he drove 16 miles.  How much money will he be reimbursed?\nassistant\nTo calculate Lennon's reimbursement, we need to multiply the number of miles he drove each day by the reimbursement rate and then sum up the total.\nOn Monday, he drove 18 miles and received $0.36/mile x 18 miles = $6.48 in reimbursement.\nOn Tuesday, he drove 26 miles and received $0.36/mile x 26 miles = $9.36 in reimbursement.\nOn Wednesday, he drove 20 miles and received $0.36/mile x 20 miles = $7.20 in reimbursement.\nOn Thursday, he drove 20 miles and received $0.36/mile x 20 miles = $7.20 in reimbursement.\nOn Friday, he drove 16 miles and received $0.36/mile x 16 miles = $5.76 in reimbursement.\nNow, we can add up the reimbursement amounts for each day to get the total reimbursement amount:\n$6.48 + $9.36 + $7.20 + $7.20 + $5.76 = $36.30\nTherefore, Lennon will be reimbursed $36.30."

Mr. and Mrs. Martin each get a regular scoop, so that's 2 regular scoops × $4 = $8.\n2. Their two children each get a kiddie scoop, so that's 2 kiddie scoops × $3 = $6.\n3. Their three teenage children each get a double scoop, so that's 3 double scoops × $6 = $18.\n\nNow, we add up the costs:\n- Regular scoops: $8\n- Kiddie scoops: $6\n- Double scoops: $18\n\nTotal: $8 + $6 + $18 = $32\n\nTherefore, Mrs. Martin pays $32 to the cashier."

If he got 2 demerits per instance for showing up late 6 times and 15 demerits for making an inappropriate joke, how many more demerits can he get this month before getting fired?\nassistant\nLet's break down Andy's demerits:\n\n- He got 2 demerits for each instance of being late, and he did this 6 times. So, he got 2 demerits * 6 instances = 12 demerits for being late.\n- He also got 15 demerits for making an inappropriate joke.\n\nNow, let's add these up:\n12 demerits (late) + 15 demerits (joke) = 27 demerits in total.\n\nAndy can get 50 demerits in a month before getting fired. So, he has already used up 27 demerits.\n\nTo find out how many more demerits he can get, we subtract the demerits he has already used from the maximum he can get:\n50 demerits - 27 demerits = 23 more demerits.\n\nSo, Andy can get 23 more demerits before getting fired this month."

This past summer, he did a challenging three-day hike across 50 kilometers of wilderness. The first day, he covered 10 kilometers of steep mountainside. The second day was flatter and he was able to cover half the full hike distance. How many kilometers did he have to hike on the third day to finish the hike?\nassistant\nTo find out how many kilometers Ezekiel had to hike on the third day to finish the hike, we can break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. First, we know that the total hike distance is 50 kilometers.\n2. The first day was 10 kilometers.\n3. The second day was flatter, covering half the full hike distance. Since the total distance is 50 kilometers, half of 50 kilometers is 25 kilometers.\n4. To find out how many kilometers he had to hike on the third day, we subtract the distance he covered on the first two days from the total distance. \n\nLet's do the math:\n\n10 kilometers (first day) + 25 kilometers (second day) = 35 kilometers\n50 kilometers (total) - 35 kilometers (first two days) = 15 kilometers\n\nSo, Ezekiel had to hike 15 kilometers on the third day to finish the hike."

On the second day, he covered half the full hike distance, which is 50 kilometers / 2 = 25 kilometers.\n3. The total distance covered in the first two days is 10 kilometers + 25 kilometers = 35 kilometers.\n4. Ezekiel's total hike distance is 50 kilometers.\n5. To find out how many kilometers he had to hike on the third day, we subtract the distance covered in the first two days from the total distance: 50 kilometers - 35 kilometers = 15 kilometers.\n\nSo, Ezekiel had to hike 15 kilometers on the third day to finish the hike."

She gets 2 whole cookies during the day.  Basil’s cookies are packaged with 45 cookies per box.  How many boxes will she need to last her for 30 days?\nassistant\nFirst, let's calculate how many cookies Basil gets in a day. She gets 1/2 of a cookie in the morning and before bed, which totals 1/2 + 1/2 = 1 cookie. She also gets 2 whole cookies during the day. So, in total, she gets 1 + 2 = 3 cookies per day.\n\nNow, let's calculate how many cookies she will need for 30 days. Since she gets 3 cookies per day, in 30 days she will need 3 * 30 = 90 cookies.\n\nFinally, let's calculate how many boxes she will need. Each box contains 45 cookies, so we divide the total number of cookies needed (90) by the number of cookies per box (45) to get the number of boxes she will need. 90 / 45 = 2 boxes.\n\nTherefore, Basil will need 2 boxes of cookies to last her for 30 days."
