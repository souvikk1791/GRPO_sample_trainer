completions ["Let's solve this step by step:\n\n1. Calculate the total bill before gratuities:\n   - NY Striploin: $80\n   - Glass of wine: $10\n   - Sales tax: 10% of $140\n   - Total before gratuities: $80 + $10 + (0.10 * $140)\n\n2. Calculate the total before gratuities:\n   - Total before gratuities = $80 + $10 + (0.10 * $140)\n   - Total before gratuities = $90 + $14\n   - Total before gratuities = $104\n\n3. Calculate the gratuities:\n   - Gratuities = Total before gratuities - Total bill\n   - Gratuities = $104 - $140\n   - Gratuities = -$36\n\nTherefore, the shady restaurant charged the customer $36 for gratuities."
 "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Calculate the total bill including tax:**\n   - The total bill before tax is $140.\n   - The sales tax rate is 10%.\n   - To calculate the tax amount, multiply the total bill by the tax rate:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Tax} = 140 \\times 0.10 = 14\n     \\]\n   - Now, add the tax to the total bill to get the total bill including tax:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total bill including tax} = 140 + 14 = 154\n     \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the gratuities:**\n   - The total bill including tax is $154.\n   - The order for a NY Striploin for $80 and a glass of wine for $10.\n   - The gratuities are the difference between the total bill including tax and the sum of the items ordered:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Gratuities} = 154 - (80 + 10) = 154 - 90 = 64\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the restaurant charged $64 for gratuities."
 "Let's denote the amount of fish caught by Ali, Peter, and Joey as \\( A \\), \\( P \\), and \\( J \\) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:\n\n1. The fish Ali caught weighed, in sum, twice as much as the fish that Peter caught. This can be written as:\n   \\[\n   A = 2P\n   \\]\n\n2. Joey caught 1 kg more fish than Peter. This can be written as:\n   \\[\n   J = P + 1\n   \\]\n\n3. Together, they caught 25 kg of fish. This can be written as:\n   \\[\n   A + P + J = 25\n   \\]\n\nWe can substitute the expressions for \\( A \\) and \\( J \\) from the first two equations into the third equation:\n\\[\n2P + P + (P + 1) = 25\n\\]\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\\[\n4P + 1 = 25\n\\]\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\\[\n4P = 24\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\\[\nP = 6\n\\]\n\nNow that we know Peter caught 6 kg of fish, we can find the amount of fish Ali caught using the first equation:\n\\[\nA = 2P = 2 \\times 6 = 12\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Ali caught 12 kg of fish. The answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{12}\n\\]"
 "Let's denote the amount of fish caught by Ali, Peter, and Joey as A, P, and J respectively. According to the problem, we have the following relationships:\n\n1. A = 2P (Ali caught twice as much as Peter)\n2. J = P + 1 (Joey caught 1 kg more than Peter)\n3. A + P + J = 25 (Together they caught 25 kg of fish)\n\nWe can substitute A and J in terms of P into the third equation to get:\n2P + P + (P + 1) = 25\n5P + 1 = 25\n5P = 24\nP = 24 / 5\nP = 4.8\n\nNow that we know Peter caught 4.8 kg of fish, we can find out how much Ali and Joey caught using the relationship A = 2P:\n\nA = 2 * 4.8\nA = 9.6 kg\n\nTherefore, Ali caught 9.6 kg of fish."
 'To find out how many markers each student in the last group receives, we first need to calculate the total number of markers needed for each group and then determine how many markers each group receives from the 22 boxes.\n\nFor the first group:\n10 students * 2 markers/student = 20 markers\n\nFor the second group:\n15 students * 4 markers/student = 60 markers\n\nTotal markers needed for the first group:\n20 markers\n\nTotal markers needed for the second group:\n60 markers\n\nTotal markers needed for both groups:\n20 markers + 60 markers = 80 markers\n\nNow, we need to find out how many markers each box contains:\n22 boxes * 5 markers/box = 110 markers\n\nSince the first group already has 20 markers, we subtract this from the total markers needed:\n80 markers - 20 markers = 60 markers\n\nFinally, we divide the remaining markers by the number of boxes each group gets:\n60 markers / 2 boxes = 30 markers per box\n\nSince each box contains 5 markers:\n30 markers / 5 markers/box = 6 markers per student in the last group\n\nEach student in the last group receives 6 markers.'
 "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The first group has 10 students and needs 2 markers each, so they need 10 * 2 = 20 markers.\n2. The second group has 15 students and needs 4 markers each, so they need 15 * 4 = 60 markers.\n3. The total number of markers needed is 20 + 60 = 80 markers.\n4. There are 22 boxes of markers, and each box contains 5 markers, so there are a total of 22 * 5 = 110 markers.\n5. We have already accounted for 80 markers, so there are 110 - 80 = 30 markers left to distribute.\n6. The last group has 15 students, and they are supposed to get 4 markers each, so they need 15 * 4 = 60 markers.\n7. Therefore, the last group will receive 60 markers out of the 30 that are left to be distributed.\n\nAnswer: Each of the students in the last group receives 6 markers."
 "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. We know there are 32 tables in total.\n2. Half of these tables have 2 chairs each, so there are 32 / 2 = 16 tables with 2 chairs each.\n3. 5 tables have 3 chairs each, so they contribute 5 * 3 = 15 chairs.\n4. The remaining tables are 32 - 16 - 5 = 11 tables with 4 chairs each.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of chairs:\n\n- 16 tables with 2 chairs each: 16 * 2 = 32 chairs\n- 5 tables with 3 chairs each: 5 * 3 = 15 chairs\n- 11 tables with 4 chairs each: 11 * 4 = 44 chairs\n\nAdding them all up:\n\n32 (from 2 chairs tables) + 15 (from 3 chairs tables) + 44 (from 4 chairs tables) = 91 chairs\n\nSo, there are 91 chairs in total in the hall."
 "First, let's determine how many tables have 2 chairs each and how many have 3 chairs each. There are 32 tables in total, so half of them have 2 chairs each, which is 32/2 = 16 tables. The other half of the tables have 3 chairs each, which is also 16 tables. \n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of chairs for the tables with 2 chairs each:\n16 tables * 2 chairs/table = 32 chairs\n\nNext, let's calculate the total number of chairs for the tables with 3 chairs each:\n16 tables * 3 chairs/table = 48 chairs\n\nFinally, let's calculate the total number of chairs for the tables with 4 chairs each:\n8 tables * 4 chairs/table = 32 chairs\n\nNow, let's add up the chairs from all the tables:\n32 chairs + 48 chairs + 32 chairs = 112 chairs\n\nSo, there are 112 chairs in total in the hall."
 "First, let's calculate how many apples Kylie picked in the second hour. She doubles her apple picking rate, so she picks 66 * 2 = 132 apples in the second hour.\n\nNext, let's calculate how many apples Kylie picked in the third hour. She picks a third of the apples picked in the first hour, so she picks 66 / 3 = 22 apples in the third hour.\n\nNow, let's add up the total number of apples picked in all three hours:\n\n66 (first hour) + 132 (second hour) + 22 (third hour) = 220 apples\n\nTherefore, Kylie picked a total of 220 apples."
 "To find out the total number of apples Kylie picked, let's break down the information given:\n\n1. First hour: 66 apples\n2. Second hour: She doubles her apple picking rate, so she picks \\(2 \\times 66 = 132\\) apples\n3. Third hour: She picks a third of the apples picked in the first hour, so she picks \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times 66 = 22\\) apples\n\nNow, let's add up the apples from all three hours:\n\nTotal apples = Apples picked in the first hour + Apples picked in the second hour + Apples picked in the third hour\nTotal apples = 66 + 132 + 22\nTotal apples = 220\n\nKylie picked a total of 220 apples."

Therefore, Bran does not need to pay anything more.\n\nAnswer: $0"
 '<reasoning>\n1. First, we need to find the total number of students from both classes. Since the class of 10 students merged with another class of 10 students, the total number of students is:\n   10 (from the first class) + 10 (from the second class) = 20 students\n\n2. Next, we need to find the total number of chaperones. There are 5 parents and 2 teachers, so:\n   5 (parents) + 2 (teachers) = 7 chaperones\n\n3. Now, we need to find the total number of individuals at the zoo. We add the number of students and the number of chaperones:\n   20 (students) + 7 (chaperones) = 27 individuals\n\n4.

 "To solve this problem, we need to account for both the number of cards Jed collects and the number of cards he gives away over time. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial cards**: Jed starts with 20 cards.\n2. **Weekly cards**: Jed collects 6 cards each week.\n3. **Every two weeks, he gives away 2 cards**: This means that for every two weeks, Jed gives away 2 cards. Since there are two weeks in a week, Jed will give away 2 cards every two weeks.\n\nLet's calculate how many weeks it takes for Jed to have 40 cards:\n\n- After the first two weeks, Jed will have given away \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\) cards.\n- After the next two weeks, Jed will have given away \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\) cards.\n- After the third two weeks, Jed will have given away \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\) cards.\n- After the fourth two weeks, Jed will have given away \\(2 \\times 2 = 4\\) cards.\n\nNow, let's add up the total number of cards Jed has after each two-week period:\n\n- After the first two weeks: \\(20 + 6 + 4 = 20 + 10 = 30\\) cards.\n- After the next two weeks: \\(20 + 6 + 4 = 20 + 10 = 30\\) cards.\n- After the third two weeks: \\(20 + 6 + 4 = 20 + 10 = 30\\) cards.\n- After the fourth two weeks: \\(20 + 6 + 4 = 20 + 10 = 30\\) cards.\n\nSince Jed ends up with 30 cards after the fourth two-week period, and he gives away 4 cards each two weeks, we can now calculate the number of weeks it took for him to reach 40 cards:\n\n- After 4 two-week periods, he will have given away \\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\) cards.\n- To reach 40 cards, he needs to have \\(40 - 8 = 32\\) cards left.\n\nSince he gives away 4 cards every two weeks, he will need an additional \\(32 / 4 = 8\\) two-week periods to reach 32 cards.\n\nTherefore, the total number of weeks it will take for Jed to have 40 cards is \\(4 + 8 = 12\\) weeks.\n\nThe answer is 12 weeks."
 "Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. Jed starts with 20 cards.\n2. Every week, he gets 6 cards, so after 2 weeks (since he gets cards every two weeks), he would have:\n   6 cards/week Ã 2 weeks = 12 cards\n3. Every two weeks, he gives away 2 cards, so after 2 weeks, he would have:\n   12 cards - 2 cards = 10 cards\n4. After another 2 weeks (since he gets cards every two weeks), he would have:\n   10 cards + 6 cards = 16 cards\n5. After another 2 weeks, he would have:\n   16 cards - 2 cards = 14 cards\n6. After another 2 weeks, he would have:\n   14 cards + 6 cards = 20 cards\n\nSo, after 6 weeks, Jed will have a total of 40 cards."
 'To determine the number of students that the school can accommodate, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the number of classrooms with 30 desks.\n2.

The entree costs $5 more than the dessert: E = D + 5\n2. The total cost of the entree and dessert is $23: E + D = 23\n\nNow, we can use these two equations to solve for E. First, let's substitute the expression for E from the first equation into the second equation:\n\n(D + 5) + D = 23\n\nNow, let's simplify and solve for D:\n\n2D + 5 = 23\n2D = 23 - 5\n2D = 18\nD = 18 / 2\nD = 9\n\nNow that we have the cost of the dessert, we can use the first equation to find the cost of the entree:\n\nE = D + 5\nE = 9 + 5\nE = 14\n\nSo, the entree costs $14."
 "Let's denote the cost of the dessert as \\( x \\) dollars. According to the problem, the entree costs $5 more than the dessert, so the cost of the entree is \\( x + 5 \\) dollars.\n\nThe total cost of the entree and the dessert is given as $23. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\\[ x + (x + 5) = 23 \\]\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\\[ 2x + 5 = 23 \\]\n\nNext, we isolate \\( x \\) by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 2x = 18 \\]\n\nThen, we solve for \\( x \\) by dividing both sides by 2:\n\\[ x = 9 \\]\n\nSo, the cost of the dessert is $9. To find the cost of the entree, we add $5 to $9:\n\\[ x + 5 = 9 + 5 = 14 \\]\n\nTherefore, the entree costs \\(\\boxed{14}\\) dollars."]
