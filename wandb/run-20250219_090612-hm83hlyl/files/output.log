To solve this problem, we need to determine the depth of the river in mid-July. We know that by mid-May, the river is 5 feet deep. By mid-June, the river is 10 feet deeper than mid-May, so the depth of the river in mid-June is 5 + 10 = 15 feet. By mid-July, the river is three times deeper than mid-June, so the depth of the river in mid-July is 15 * 3 = 45 feet. Therefore, the depth of the river by mid-July is 45 feet. The answer is 45.
questions In mid-May, the river flowing through Moreland is five feet deep. By mid-June, the river is 10 feet deeper than mid-May. By mid-July, the river is three times deeper than mid-June. How many feet deep is the river by mid-July?

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the depth of the river in mid-July. Let's break it down step by step:

1. In mid-May, the river is 5 feet deep.
2. By mid-June, the river is 10 feet deeper than mid-May, so it is 5 + 10 = 15 feet deep.
3. By mid-July, the river is three times deeper than mid-June, so it is 15 * 3 = 45 feet deep.

Therefore, the river is 45 feet deep by mid-July.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total miles Nicki ran in the first half of the year and the second half of the year separately, and then add them together. For the first half of the year, she ran 20 miles per week for 4 weeks, which is 20 * 4 = 80 miles. For the second half of the year, she ran 30 miles per week for 4 weeks, which is 30 * 4 = 120 miles. Therefore, the total miles she ran for the year is 80 + 120 = 200 miles.
