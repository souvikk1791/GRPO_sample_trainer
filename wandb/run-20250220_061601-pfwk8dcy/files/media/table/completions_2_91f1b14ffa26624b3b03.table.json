If 8 kids and 10 adults swim in his swimming pool per day, how much money will he earn per week?", "588", "First, let's calculate the earnings for the kids. Since Jose charges $3 for kids and 8 kids swim in the pool per day, the earnings for the kids would be:\n$3 * 8 = $24\n\nNext, let's calculate the earnings for the adults. Since Jose charges twice the amount for adults as for kids, he charges $6 for each adult. 10 adults swim in the pool per day, so the earnings for the adults would be:\n$6 * 10 = $60\n\nNow, let's add the earnings for both kids and adults to find the total daily earnings:\n$24 + $60 = $84\n\nFinally, to find the weekly earnings, we multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in a week:\n$84 * 7 = $588\n\nSo, Jose will earn $588 per week from the swimming pool.", 0.0], ["Four classmates were comparing their ages based on their birth month.
