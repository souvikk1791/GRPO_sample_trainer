If Carson uses 60 gallons of seed and fertilizer combined, how many gallons of seed does he use?", "45", "Let's denote the amount of fertilizer used by \\( F \\) gallons. According to the problem, each square meter needs three times as much seed as fertilizer, so the amount of seed used is \\( 3F \\) gallons.\n\nThe total amount of seed and fertilizer used is 60 gallons. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ 3F + F = 60 \\]\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n\\[ 4F = 60 \\]\n\nNow, solve for \\( F \\):\n\n\\[ F = \\frac{60}{4} \\]\n\\[ F = 15 \\]\n\nSo, Carson uses 15 gallons of fertilizer.\n\nTo find the amount of seed used, we multiply the amount of fertilizer by 3:\n\n\\[ 3F = 3 \\times 15 \\]\n\\[ 3F = 45 \\]\n\nTherefore, Carson uses 45 gallons of seed.", 0.0], ["Farmer Red has three milk cows: Bess, Brownie, and Daisy.
