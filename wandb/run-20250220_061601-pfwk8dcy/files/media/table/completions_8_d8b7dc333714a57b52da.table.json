Therefore, the total number of stamps needed for these envelopes is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\text{ envelopes} \\times 2 \\text{ stamps/envelope} = 12 \\text{ stamps}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the remaining stamps:** Micah has 52 stamps in total. Subtract the 12 stamps needed for the 6 envelopes from the total stamps to find out how many stamps he has left:\n   \\[\n   52 \\text{ stamps} - 12 \\text{ stamps} = 40 \\text{ stamps}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the weight of the remaining envelopes:** Since the remaining 40 stamps correspond to the envelopes that weigh more than 5 pounds, each of these envelopes will need 5 stamps. Therefore, the total number of stamps needed for these remaining envelopes is:\n   \\[\n   40 \\text{ envelopes} \\times 5 \\text{ stamps/envelope} = 200 \\text{ stamps}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Determine the number of envelopes that weigh more than 5 pounds:** Since each of the 40 remaining envelopes weighs more than 5 pounds, the number of these envelopes is:\n   \\[\n   40 \\text{ envelopes}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate the number of envelopes that weigh less than 5 pounds:** The total number of envelopes Micah bought is 52, and 6 of them weigh more than 5 pounds. Therefore, the number of envelopes that weigh less than 5 pounds is:\n   \\[\n   52 \\text{ envelopes} - 6 \\text{ envelopes} = 46 \\text{ envelopes}\n   \\]\n\n6. **Calculate the total number of envelopes:** Add the number of envelopes that weigh less than 5 pounds to the number of envelopes that weigh more than 5 pounds to find the total number of envelopes:\n   \\[\n   46 \\text{ envelopes} + 6 \\text{ envelopes} = 52 \\text{ envelopes}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Micah needed to buy a total of 52 envelopes.", 0.0], ["The white rabbit can hop 15 meters in one minute.
