How many pencils did Autumn have left?", "16", "To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. Autumn initially had 20 pencils.\n2. In the first month, she misplaced 7 pencils, so she had 20 - 7 = 13 pencils left.\n3. She also broke 3 pencils, so she had 13 - 3 = 10 pencils left.\n4. She then found 4 pencils, so she had 10 + 4 = 14 pencils left.\n5. Finally, she bought 2 more pencils, so she had 14 + 2 = 16 pencils left.\n\nTherefore, Autumn had 16 pencils left.", 0.0], ["Justin is 26 years old. When he was born his elder sister Jessica was 6 years old. James is their elder brother and is 7 years older than Jessica. How old will James be after 5 years?", "44", "To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages of Justin, Jessica, and James based on the information given.\n\n1. Justin is 26 years old.\n2. When Justin was born, Jessica was 6 years old. Since Justin is 26 years old now, Jessica must be 26 - 6 = 20 years old.\n3. James is 7 years older than Jessica. Therefore, James is 20 + 7 = 27 years old.\n4. To find out how old James will be after 5 years, we simply add 5 to his current age: 27 + 5 = 32 years old.\n\nTherefore, after 5 years, James will be 32 years old.", 0.0], ["Alexis can sew a skirt in 2 hours and a coat in 7 hours. How long does it take for Alexis to sew 6 skirts and 4 coats?", "40", "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time it takes for Alexis to sew 6 skirts and 4 coats.\n\n1. First, we need to find the time it takes to sew one skirt. Since Alexis can sew a skirt in 2 hours, it takes her 2 minutes per skirt.\n2. Next, we need to find the time it takes to sew one coat. Since Alexis can sew a coat in 7 hours, it takes her 1 hour and 30 minutes per coat.\n3. Now, we can calculate the total time it takes to sew 6 skirts and 4 coats. Since each skirt takes 2 minutes and each coat takes 1 hour and 30 minutes, the total time for 6 skirts is 120 minutes (2 minutes/skirt * 6 skirts) and the total time for 4 coats is 4 hours (1 hour and 30 minutes/coat * 4 coats).\n4. To add the two times together, we need to convert the total time for skirts and coats from minutes to hours. 120 minutes is equal to 2 hours (since 120 minutes = 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour), and 4 hours is equal to 2 hours (since 4 hours = 2 hours * 2).\n5. Finally, we can add the two times together to get the total time it takes for Alexis to sew 6 skirts and 4 coats: 2 hours + 2 hours = 4 hours.\n\nTherefore, it takes Alexis 4 hours to sew 6 skirts and 4 coats.", 0.0], ["Mary is chopping up some old furniture to make firewood.
