How many horses does Mickey Mount per week?", "98", "Let's define the number of horses Minnie mounts per day as \\( M \\). According to the problem, Minnie mounts three more horses per day than there are days in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, Minnie mounts \\( M + 3 \\) horses per day. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n\n\\[ M + 3 = M \\]\n\nTo find \\( M \\), we subtract \\( M \\) from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ 3 = 0 \\]\n\nThis equation is not possible unless we interpret it correctly. Let's re-evaluate the problem statement and the relationships between the number of horses. The correct interpretation is that the number of horses Minnie mounts per day is 3 more than the number of horses Mickey mounts per day, which is given as 6 less than twice as many horses as Minnie mounts per day. This means:\n\n\\[ M + 3 = 2(M - 6) \\]\n\nNow, let's solve for \\( M \\):\n\n\\[ M + 3 = 2M - 12 \\]\n\\[ 3 + 12 = 2M - M \\]\n\\[ 15 = M \\]\n\nSo, Minnie mounts 15 horses per day. Now, we can find out how many horses Mickey mounts per day. Since Mickey mounts six less than twice as many horses as Minnie mounts per day, we have:\n\n\\[ M_{\\text{Mickey}} = 2M_{\\text{Minnie}} - 6 = 2 \\times 15 - 6 = 30 - 6 = 24 \\]\n\nNow, to find out how many horses Mickey mounts per week, we multiply the number of horses he mounts per day by 7:\n\n\\[ M_{\\text{Mickey}}_{\\text{per week}} = 24 \\times 7 = 168 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of horses Mickey mounts per week is \\(\\boxed{168}\\).", 0.0], ["Cowboy Mickey and cowgirl Minnie train horses for a living.
