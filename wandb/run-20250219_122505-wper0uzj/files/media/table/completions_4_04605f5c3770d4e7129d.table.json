The first sister is also 1 year younger than Maiya, so we can write the equation:\n\\[ 2M = M - 1 \\]\n\nNow, let's solve this equation for \\( M \\):\n\\[ 2M - M = -1 \\]\n\\[ M = -1 \\]\n\nHowever, this result is not possible because age cannot be negative. Let's re-evaluate the problem. It seems there was a misunderstanding in the problem statement.

Let's try another approach. Since the average age is 5, the sum of Maiya's and her two sisters' ages is \\( 5 \\times 2 = 10 \\). If the first sister's age is \\( 2M \\), then the second sister's age is \\( 2M - 1 \\).

Let's try the correct interpretation of the problem. If the first sister is 1 year older than Maiya, then the first sister's age is \\( 2M + 1 \\). The sum of their ages is 10, so:\n\\[ 2M + (2M + 1) = 10 \\]\n\\[ 4M + 1 = 10 \\]\n\\[ 4M = 9 \\]\n\\[ M = \\frac{9}{4} \\]\n\nThis result is still not possible.
