He drives daily forth and back from his home to his workplace which is 60 miles away from his home.\n3. To calculate the total time Terry spends driving, we need to consider the distance he travels each way and the time it takes to travel that distance.\n4. The distance from Terry's home to his workplace is 60 miles.\n5. The time it takes to travel 60 miles at a speed of 40 miles per hour is 60 miles / 40 miles per hour = 1.5 hours.\n6. Since Terry drives forth and back, the total time he spends driving is 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 3 hours.\n7.
