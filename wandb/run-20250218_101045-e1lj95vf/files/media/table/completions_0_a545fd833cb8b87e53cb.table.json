If he works 8 hours a day for 6 days a week, how much is his hourly rate?\n<Reasoning>\nEdric's monthly salary is $576. If he works 8 hours a day for 6 days a week, how much is his hourly rate?\n<Your Step by Step Reasoning Process Here>\n1. First, we need to calculate the total number of hours Edric works in a week.\n2. Since he works 8 hours a day for 6 days a week, we can calculate the total number of hours by multiplying 8 hours/day by 6 days.\n3. Total hours = 8 hours/day * 6 days = 48 hours.\n4. Now, we need to calculate the total number of hours Edric works in a month.\n5. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we can calculate the total number of hours by multiplying 48 hours/day by 4 weeks.\n6. Total hours = 48 hours/day * 4 weeks = 192 hours.\n7. Now, we need to calculate the total number of hours Edric works in a year.\n8. Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we can calculate the total number of hours by multiplying 192 hours/day by 52 days.\n9. Total hours = 192 hours/day * 52 days = 99,360 hours.\n10. Finally, we need to calculate the hourly rate.\n11. To do this, we divide the total number of hours by the total number of days in a month.\n12. Hourly rate = 99,360 hours / 4 weeks * 6 days = $19,890.\n13. Therefore, Edric's hourly rate is $19,890.\n<Your Answer>\nEdric's hourly rate is $19,890.\n<decimal>", 0.0], ["A row of houses all share a community space where they put up their clotheslines.

Each adult currently has 3 items of clothing on the clotheslines.\n5. Each clothesline can hold 2 items of clothing.\n6. All of the clotheslines are full.\n7. We need to find the number of houses on the street.\n8. Let's use the given information to set up an equation.\n9. Let x be the number of houses on the street.\n10. Each house has 2 clotheslines.\n11. So, the total number of clotheslines is 2x.\n12. Each house has 11 children and 20 adults.\n13. So, the total number of children is 11x.\n14. The total number of adults is 20x.\n15. Each child currently has 4 items of clothing on the clotheslines.\n16. So, the total number of items of clothing for the children is 4 * 11x = 44x.\n17. Each adult currently has 3 items of clothing on the clotheslines.\n18. So, the total number of items of clothing for the adults is 3 * 20x = 60x.\n19. The total number of items of clothing for all the children and adults is 44x + 60x = 104x.\n20. Each clothesline can hold 2 items of clothing.\n21. So, the total number of clotheslines needed is 104x / 2 = 52x.\n22. All of the clotheslines are full.\n23. So, the total number of clotheslines is 52x.\n24. We know that the total number of clotheslines is 2x.\n25. So, 2x = 52x.\n26. Solving for x, we get x = 25.\n27. Therefore, there are 25 houses on the street.\n28.
