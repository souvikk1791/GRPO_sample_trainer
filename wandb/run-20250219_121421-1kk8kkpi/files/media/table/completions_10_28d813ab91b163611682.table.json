Since the recipe serves four people and Perry added a half cup of cream, we can calculate the total grams of fat as follows:\n\nTotal grams of fat = (Half cup of cream) x (Grams of fat per cup)\n\nTotal grams of fat = (0.5 cups) x (88 grams of fat per cup)\n\nTotal grams of fat = 44 grams\n\nNow that we know the total grams of fat added to the recipe, we can calculate the grams of fat per serving by dividing the total grams of fat by the number of servings:\n\nGrams of fat per serving = (Total grams of fat) / (Number of servings)\n\nGrams of fat per serving = (44 grams) / (4 servings)\n\nGrams of fat per serving = 11 grams\n\nTherefore, 11 grams of fat were added to each serving of food.", 0.0], ["Perry made a recipe that serves four people.
