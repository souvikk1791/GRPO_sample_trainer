First, we need to find the total number of sub-branches on all the trees. Since there are 4 trees and each tree has 10 branches, we multiply 10 by 4:\n   10 branches/tree * 4 trees = 40 branches\n\n2. Each branch has 40 sub-branches, so the total number of sub-branches is:\n   40 branches * 40 sub-branches/branch = 1600 sub-branches\n\n3. Now, we need to find out how many leaves are on all the sub-branches. Since each sub-branch has 60 leaves, we multiply 60 by the total number of sub-branches:\n   60 leaves/sub-branch * 1600 sub-branches = 96,000 leaves\n\n4. Finally, we need to find out how many leaves are on all the trees.
