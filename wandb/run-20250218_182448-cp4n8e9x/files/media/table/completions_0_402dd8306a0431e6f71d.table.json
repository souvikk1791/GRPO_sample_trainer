The largest hole leaks at a rate of 3 ounces of water  per minute.  The medium-sized hole leaks water at one-half the rate of the largest hole.  And the smallest hole leaks water at a rate of one-third the rate of the medium-sized hole.  When it rains, what is the combined amount of water, in ounces, that leak from all three holes over a 2-hour time period?", "600", "\nuser\n<reasoning> \n1. First, we need to find the rate at which each hole leaks water. The largest hole leaks at a rate of 3 ounces per minute.\n2. The medium-sized hole leaks water at one-half the rate of the largest hole, so it leaks at a rate of 3/2 ounces per minute.\n3. The smallest hole leaks water at a rate of one-third the rate of the medium-sized hole, so it leaks at a rate of (3/2)/3 ounces per minute.\n4. To find the combined amount of water that leaks from all three holes over a 2-hour time period, we need to convert the time from hours to minutes, which is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.\n5. We then multiply the rate of each hole by the number of minutes in the time period and add the results together to find the total amount of water leaked.\n\nTherefore, the combined amount of water that leaks from all three holes over a 2-hour time period is 3 * 120 + 3/2 * 120 + (3/2)/3 * 120 = 360 + 180 + 120 = 660 ounces.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>660</answer>", 0.625], ["When it rains, the three holes in the garage roof leak water at different rates.

Now we can add up the rates of all three holes to find the combined amount of water that leaks from all three holes over a 2-hour time period.\n5. 2 hours is equal to 120 minutes, so we can calculate the combined amount of water as follows: 3 + (3/2) + ((3/2)/3) * 120.\n6. Simplifying this expression, we get: 3 + 3/2 + 1 = 5.5 ounces.\n7. Therefore, the combined amount of water that leaks from all three holes over a 2-hour time period is 5.5 ounces.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>5.5 ounces</answer>", 0.125], ["There are 336 books in a library.
