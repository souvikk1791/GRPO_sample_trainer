We know that 1/4 inch represents 8 miles of actual road distance.\n2. The towns of Pence and Hillcrest are represented by points 3 3/8 inches apart on the map.\n3. To find the actual distance between the towns, we need to multiply the distance represented by the map points by the ratio of the actual distance to the distance represented by the map points.\n4. The ratio of the actual distance to the distance represented by the map points is 1/4 inch / 3 3/8 inches.\n5. To simplify the ratio, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 8 to get 2/12 inches.\n6. Now, we can multiply the actual distance represented by the map points by the simplified ratio: 2/12 inches * 8 miles = 16/12 miles.\n7. Finally, we can simplify the fraction 16/12 miles to 4/3 miles.\n8.
