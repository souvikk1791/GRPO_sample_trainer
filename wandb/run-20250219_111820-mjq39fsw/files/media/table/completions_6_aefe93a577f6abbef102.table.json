First, we need to calculate the cost of 2 pairs of jeans:\n   - The original price of one pair of jeans is $40\n   - So, the cost of 2 pairs of jeans is $40 x 2 = $80\n\n2. Now, we need to apply the 10% discount to the cost of 2 pairs of jeans:\n   - The discount is 10% of $80\n   - The discount amount is $80 x 10/100 = $8\n\n3. After applying the discount, the cost of 2 pairs of jeans becomes:\n   - $80 - $8 = $72\n\n4.
