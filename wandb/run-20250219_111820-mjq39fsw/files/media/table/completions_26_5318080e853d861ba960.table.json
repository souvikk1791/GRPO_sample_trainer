Since there are 4 times as many percussion players as there are woodwind players, we can set up the equation:\n\nWoodwind players = 4 * Brass players\n\nLet B represent the number of brass players. Then we have:\n\nWoodwind players = 4B\n\nNext, let's find the number of percussion players. Since there are twice as many percussion players as there are woodwind players, we can set up the equation:\n\nPercussion players = 2 * Woodwind players\n\nWoodwind players = 4B\n\nPercussion players = 2 * (4B)\n\nNow we can substitute the expression for Woodwind players into the equation for percussion players:\n\nPercussion players = 2 * (4B) = 8B\n\nWe know the total number of members is 110, so we can set up an equation to solve for B:\n\nWoodwind players + Percussion players + Brass players = 110\n\n4B + 8B + B = 110\n\nCombining like terms:\n\n13B = 110\n\nNow we can solve for B:\n\nB = 110 / 13\n\nB = 8.46\n\nSince the number of players must be a whole number, we can round down to the nearest whole number:\n\nB = 8\n\nSo there are 8 brass players.", 0.0], ["Frankie's parents let him have many pets.

Since he has 2 dogs and 6 of his pets have four legs, that means he has 2 + 6 = 8 pets in total, including cats and dogs. \n\nNext, we need to figure out how many cats Frankie has. Since he has 1 less parrot than cats and he has 2 dogs, that means he has 2 + 1 = 3 cats. \n\nNow, we can find out how many snakes Frankie has. Since he has 6 more snakes than he has cats, that means he has 3 + 6 = 9 snakes.\n\nNow we can calculate the total number of pets Frankie has. He has 8 cats, 3 snakes, 2 dogs, and 6 legs, so the total number of pets is 8 + 3 + 2 + 6 = 19 pets.\n\nTherefore, Frankie has a total of 19 pets.", 0.0], ["Frankie's parents let him have many pets.
