How much money did they receive in scholarship together if Wendy received a scholarship worth $20000?", "92000", "To find out how much money Nina, Kelly, and Wendy received in scholarships together, we need to determine Kelly's scholarship amount first.\n\n1. Wendy received a scholarship worth $20,000.\n2. Kelly received a scholarship worth twice the amount Wendy received. Therefore, Kelly's scholarship amount is $20,000 * 2 = $40,000.\n3. Nina received a scholarship worth $8,000 less than Kelly's amount. Therefore, Nina's scholarship amount is $40,000 - $8,000 = $32,000.\n\nNow, let's find the total amount of scholarship they received together:\n\nTotal scholarship amount = Wendy's scholarship amount + Kelly's scholarship amount + Nina's scholarship amount\nTotal scholarship amount = $20,000 + $40,000 + $32,000\nTotal scholarship amount = $92,000\n\nTherefore, they received a total of $92,000 in scholarships together.", 0.0], ["Amanda needs 12 more marbles to have twice as many marbles as Katrina, and Mabel has 5 times as many marbles as Katrina.
