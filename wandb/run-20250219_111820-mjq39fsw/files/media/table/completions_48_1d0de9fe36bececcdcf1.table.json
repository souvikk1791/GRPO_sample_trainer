First, let's calculate the monthly cost of the new apartment.\n   The new apartment is 40% more expensive than John's old apartment.\n   So, the new apartment costs $1200 + (40/100 * $1200) = $1200 + $480 = $1680 per month.\n2. Next, let's calculate the monthly cost of living alone.\n   John lives alone and the cost of living alone is $1200 per month.\n3. Now, let's calculate the monthly cost of splitting the apartment.\n   If John and his two brothers split the apartment, they each pay half of the monthly cost of the new apartment.\n   So, each person pays $1680 / 2 = $840 per month.\n4. Now, let's calculate the annual cost of living alone.\n   John pays $1200 per month, so in a year he pays $1200 * 12 = $14,400.\n   The two brothers pay $840 per month, so in a year they pay $840 * 12 = $10,080.\n5. Finally, let's calculate the annual savings.\n   The annual savings is the difference between the monthly cost of living alone and the monthly cost of splitting the apartment.\n   Annual savings = $14,400 - $10,080 = $4,320.\n</reasoning>\n<answer> John saves $4,320 per year by splitting the apartment compared to living alone. </answer>", 0.125], ["John and his two brothers decide to split the cost of an apartment.
