Let's say Gabriel collected x erasers.\n2. Since Celine collected twice as many erasers as Gabriel, Celine collected 2x erasers.\n3. Julian collected twice as many erasers as Celine, so Julian collected 2 * 2x = 4x erasers.\n4. The total number of erasers collected is the sum of the erasers collected by Celine, Gabriel, and Julian: x + 2x + 4x = 7x.\n5. We know the total number of erasers collected is 35, so we can set up the equation 7x = 35.\n6. Solving for x, we divide both sides by 7: x = 35 / 7 = 5.\n7. So Gabriel collected 5 erasers.\n8.
