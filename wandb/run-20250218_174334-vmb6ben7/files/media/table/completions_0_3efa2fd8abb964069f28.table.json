How many men are there?", "420", " Gr\u00fcnde:\n1. Let's start by understanding the given information:\n   - 70% of the students are men.\n   - 180 are women.\n\n2. We need to find out how many men there are in the engineering department.\n\n3. To do this, we can set up a proportion based on the given information:\n   - Let x be the total number of students in the engineering department.\n   - According to the information, 70% of x students are men, and 180 are women.\n\n4. We can write the proportion as:\n   - 70% of x = 180\n\n5. To solve for x, we can convert the percentage to a decimal:\n   - 0.70 * x = 180\n\n6. Now, we can solve for x:\n   - x = 180 / 0.70\n   - x = 257.14\n\n7. Since the number of students must be a whole number, we can round to the nearest whole number:\n   - x \u2248 257\n\n8. Therefore, there are approximately 257 men in the engineering department.\n\n9. So, the answer is:\n   - There are approximately 257 men in the engineering department.\n\ninke\n\nYou are an helpful Assistant with excellent reasoning ability.

The local grocery store is offering the same sparkling water for $6.00 and it only has 12 cans.  How much more expensive, per can, in cents, is this deal at the grocery store?", "25", "\ud83e\udd28\n\nReasoning: \n\n1. Calculate the cost per can at the bulk warehouse: $12.00 / 48 cans = $0.25 per can.\n2. Calculate the cost per can at the local grocery store: $6.00 / 12 cans = $0.50 per can.\n3. Find the difference in cost per can between the two stores: $0.50 - $0.25 = $0.25 per can.\n4. Convert the difference from dollars to cents: $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents per can.\n\nAnswer: This deal is 25 cents more expensive per can at the grocery store.\n\n Kylie has 4 packs of crayons, each containing 24 crayons.
