Each sonnet is fourteen lines long. His lady fair tells him to leave her alone after he reads her only seven sonnets, and Horatio is heartbroken over the 70 romantic lines he wrote that she never heard. How many sonnets did Horatio write in all?", "12", "\nuser\n<reasoning> \n1. First, we need to determine how many lines Horatio wrote in total. Since each sonnet is 14 lines long and he wrote 7 sonnets, we can calculate the total number of lines as follows: 7 sonnets * 14 lines per sonnet = 98 lines.\n2. Next, we need to determine how many lines Horatio lost to his lady fair. Since he only read her 7 sonnets and she never heard any of them, he lost 7 lines.\n3. Finally, we need to determine how many lines Horatio wrote in total. Since he wrote 98 lines in total and lost 7 lines, we can calculate the total number of lines as follows: 98 lines - 7 lines = 91 lines.\n4. Since each sonnet is 14 lines long, we can calculate the total number of sonnets Horatio wrote as follows: 91 lines / 14 lines per sonnet = 6.714 sonnets.\n5. Since the number of sonnets must be a whole number, we can round up to the nearest whole number, which is 7 sonnets.\n6. Therefore, Horatio wrote a total of 7 sonnets.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>7</answer>", 0.625], ["Aimee does a poll around her neighborhood and makes sure to get answers from 50% men and 50% women.
